# Real-Time Robot Simulation Application

This project includes a real-time robot simulation application developed using Unity 3D game engine. The application is designed to receive data from a robot via the UDP protocol and update the positions of the robot arm based on this data.

## Features

- Real-time robot simulation
- Position updates based on incoming data via UDP
- Flexible robot arm movement with high accuracy

## Requirements

- Unity 3D 
- Proficiency in C# programming language
- Basic knowledge of networking and UDP protocol
- Appropriate robot model or design for the project to work with

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Unity 3D.
3. Open the project folder in Unity.

## Usage

1. Within Unity, drag the robot model into the scene.
2. Configure the necessary settings to establish a UDP connection (IP address, port, etc.).
